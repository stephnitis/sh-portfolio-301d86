      "description": "My name is Stephanie Hill and I am a software developer who works in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am coming from a career in hospitality, which has made me an expert at working efficiently under extreme pressure. I became accomplished at leading my team and was rewarded with the responsibility of training new members. I excelled with training due to my attention to detail, my ability to assess the needs of my team members and my ability to convey the companyâ€™s values in the process. Despite the success I found in the industry, I found there to be no real safety nets or long-term benefits and needed to find a way to transition out to better provide for my future. I was drawn to this industry because I excel at adapting to dynamic environments. The fact that tech is constantly changing is exciting to me. I have worked with a diverse range of individuals, traveled extensively and consistently been able to find commonalities that bring people together. I am working towards developing software that is equitable and would love to work in a progressive environment that is open to implementing new ideas to help disenfranchised groups.",
